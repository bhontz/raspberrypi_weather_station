# raspberrypi_weather_station
GSOC 2017 Raspberry Jam project, can be used to extend the GSOC Raspberry Pi kits.

This Raspberry Pi project can be used to extend the GSOC Raspberry Pi learning kits which include a Raspberry Pi, keyboard, mouse, and monitor.
The kit is a fine introduction to showing girls how the Raspberry Pi can act as a small computer.  This extension will show how the Raspberry Pi can be used in other ways, in this case as a "sensor reader" and web server.

There are a few additional parts required beyond the basic GSOC kit, which hopefully will be available soon with the kits.
