# raspberrypi_weather_station
GSOC 2017 Raspberry Jam project, can be used to extend the GSOC Raspberry Pi kits.

This Raspberry Pi project can be used to extend the GSOC Raspberry Pi learning kits which include a Raspberry Pi, keyboard, mouse, and monitor.

The basic kit is a fine introduction for showing Girl Scouts how the Raspberry Pi can act as a small computer.  This extension will illustrate how the Raspberry Pi can be used in other ways, in this case as a "sensor reader" and as a web server.

There are a few additional parts required beyond the basic GSOC kit, which hopefully will be available soon with the kits.  They are as follows:
WiFi Dongle (the Pi 2 Model B included within the GSOC kits does not have WiFi or Bluetooth)
DHT22 temperature and humidity sensor
A breadboard, Raspberry Pi "cobbler" (i.e. breadboard to Raspberry Pi ribbon cable and pin connector)
Breadboard male end jumper wires (at minimum three at least 5" long)
A 10k ohm resistor

Refer to the step by step documentation included within this respository.  A python script (requires module Ada_Fruit_DHT) referenced within the documentation is included with this repository.
